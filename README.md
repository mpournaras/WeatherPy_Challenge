# WeatherPy_Challenge

## This challenge was issued to create product that would combine weather, location, and Google Maps driving data.

### The purpose of this product would be to, with a users desired vacation temperature range, generate a list of locations based on that temperature data and provide the user with weather and nearest hotel information as well as driving directions to help plan their trip

This particular user liked it hot and sweaty. With the parameters of a temperature ranging from 80-95 degrees farenheight he was shown that he could have a nice vaction in South East Asia, or an all-you-see rodeo around beautiful Texas!
